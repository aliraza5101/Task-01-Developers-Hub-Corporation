Project Title: Customer Segmentation System Using Unsupervised Learning
Tool Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

üîç Objective
The main goal of this project was to segment customers into distinct groups based on their spending habits and demographic data using clustering techniques. This segmentation helps businesses better understand customer needs and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

üìä Step-by-Step Approach
1. Data Collection & Exploration
The dataset was loaded using pandas and checked for null values, duplicates, and data types.

Basic statistical summaries and distributions (like Age, Annual Income, Spending Score) were explored using histograms and boxplots.

2. Feature Selection
After understanding the dataset, the most relevant features were selected for clustering:

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1-100)

These features were chosen because they directly relate to how a customer interacts with products or services.

3. Data Preprocessing
Data was scaled using StandardScaler from Scikit-learn to bring all values to the same scale.

Scaling is necessary as clustering algorithms are distance-based and sensitive to scale differences.

4. Finding Optimal Number of Clusters
The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal value of k for K-Means.

WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) was plotted against a range of k values.

The ‚Äúelbow‚Äù was clearly visible at k = 5, suggesting five optimal clusters.

5. Model Training (K-Means)
The K-Means model was trained with n_clusters = 5.

Each customer was assigned to one of the five clusters.

These clusters were added as a new column in the dataset for further analysis.

6. Cluster Visualization
Clusters were visualized using scatter plots between:

Annual Income vs Spending Score

Age vs Spending Score

Each cluster was shown with a different color to highlight customer segmentation.

üöß Challenges Faced
Subjectivity in Elbow Method:
The elbow point sometimes wasn‚Äôt sharp, so determining the best value of k needed manual judgment.

Interpretation of Clusters:
Translating numerical clusters into business-meaningful groups required visualization and logical deduction.

Limited Features:
With only three features, segmentation was good but limited. More features like gender, region, or shopping habits could improve it.

üìà Model Performance & Cluster Insights
While unsupervised learning doesn‚Äôt provide traditional accuracy metrics, visual inspection and interpretability were used to assess performance.

Key Insights from Each Cluster:
Cluster	Income	Spending	Description
0	High	High	Loyal premium customers
1	Low	Low	Budget-conscious or inactive
2	Mid	Mid	Average customers (growth segment)
3	High	Low	Potential for upselling
4	Mid	High	Active but price-sensitive buyers
These insights help businesses:

Target high spenders with loyalty programs

Engage low spenders with promotions

Retain mid-range customers through personalization

üîß Suggestions for Future Improvement
Include more features (e.g., gender, location, membership status).

Apply alternative clustering methods like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering.

Use PCA for dimensionality reduction and better 2D visualization.

Integrate the output into a dashboard or simple web app for business teams.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This project successfully implemented an end-to-end clustering system using K-Means to group customers. The five clusters were interpretable and useful for designing business strategies. With a few enhancements, this system can become a powerful decision-support tool for customer relationship management.
